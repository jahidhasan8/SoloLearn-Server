Fortunately for beginners, Python has a simple, easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python a great language to learn for beginners. Python Keywords Keywords are the reserved words in Python. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. In Python, keywords are case sensitive.There are 33 keywords in Python 3.7. This number can vary slightly over the course of time.Data types in Python, Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.Python Functions: In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.",

This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.C Math Functions: There is also a list of math functions available, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.To use them, you must include the math.h header file in your program:",

C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support. Methods. A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.Instance Variables. Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.C++ Class Definitions.When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type. This doesn't actually define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, what an object of the class will consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object.A class definition starts with the keyword class followed by the class name; and the class body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces. A class definition must be followed either by a semicolon or a list of declarations.",

James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.Java Variables: A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of vary + able which means its value can be changed.Data Types in Java: Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays",

PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP.PHP is an open-source, interpreted, and object-oriented scripting language that can be executed at the server-side. PHP is well suited for web development. Therefore, it is used to develop web applications (an application that executes on the server and generates the dynamic page.).PHP Variables : In PHP, a variable is declared using a $ sign followed by the variable name. Here, some important points to know about variables:As PHP is a loosely typed language, so we do not need to declare the data types of the variables. It automatically analyzes the values and makes conversions to its correct datatype.After declaring a variable, it can be reused throughout the code.Assignment Operator (=) is used to assign the value to a variable.PHP Constants: PHP constants are name or identifier that can't be changed during the execution of the script except for magic constants, which are not really constants. PHP constants can be defined by 2 ways:Using define() function Using const keyword Constants are similar to the variable except once they defined, they can never be undefined or changed. They remain constant across the entire program. PHP constants follow the same PHP variable rules.PHP Operators: PHP Operator is a symbol i.e used to perform operations on operands. In simple words, operators are used to perform operations on variables or values.PHP Operators can be categorized in following forms: Arithmetic Operators , Assignment Operators, Bitwise Operators, Comparison Operators, Incrementing/Decrementing Operators, Logical Operators, String Operators, Array Operators, Type Operators, Execution Operators,Error Control Operators.",

        "description":"Go language is a programming language initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically-typed language having syntax similar to that of C. It provides garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capability, many advanced built-in types such as variable length arrays and key-value maps. It also provides a rich standard library. The Go programming language was launched in November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of computer programming terminologies. If you have a good command over C, then it would be quite easy for you to understand the concepts of Go programming and move fast on the learning track.Go - Data Types: In the Go programming language, data types refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.Boolean types,Numeric types,String types, Derived types, Integer Types,Floating Types etc.Go - Variables: A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that the programs can manipulate. Each variable in Go has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory, the range of values that can be stored within that memory, and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because Go is case-sensitive.byte, int, float32.Go - Operators: An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. Go language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators −Arithmetic Operators, Relational Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, Assignment Operators, Miscellaneous Operators. Go - Functions: A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every Go program has at least one function, which is main(). You can divide your code into separate functions. How you divide your code among different functions is up to you, but logically, the division should be such that each function performs a specific task.A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.The Go standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, the function len() takes arguments of various types and returns the length of the type. If a string is passed to it, the function returns the length of the string in bytes. If an array is passed to it, the function returns the length of the array.",
